# Kitchen Remodel Scope Statement
As the homeowers we want to reorient and refresh the kitchen to achieve:
* improved flow within the house
* increased work area in the kitchen
* more effective pantry storage
* and better utilization of dead space between the kitchen and deck

## Goals
* Renovate at an appropriate value level for the property (avoid over-improving)
* Perpetuate the mid-century vibe of the house

## Requirements
* larger fridge + more freezer space
* larger sink
* hood vented outside
* microwave
* coffee area (espresso machine + grinder)

## Nice To Have
* Island
* View from the kitchen
* larger doors to deck (bridge outside / inside)

## Demo
* Disconnect plumbing / electrical
