# Kitchen Remodel Scope Statement
As the homeowers we want to reorient and refresh the kitchen to achieve:
* improved flow within the house
* increased work area in the kitchen
* more effective pantry storage
* and better utilization of dead space between the kitchen and deck

# Goals
* Renovate at an appropriate value level for the property (avoid over-improving)
* Perpetuate the mid-century vibe of the house

# Requirements
* larger fridge + more freezer space
* larger sink
* hood vented outside
* microwave
* coffee area (espresso machine + grinder)

## Nice To Have
* Island
* View from the kitchen
* larger doors to deck (bridge outside / inside)

* Clear current kitchen area and cabinets of "stuff"
  - setup temporary means of making food
* Ramboard over any flooring that needs protected
* Isolate demo area with plastic sheeting

## Demo
* Disconnect plumbing / electrical
* Remove existing countertops + cabinets Fixtures
* Remove drywall to expose work area for electrical and plumbing needs
* Remove finished floor (vinyl + parquet wood) to subfloor in defined area
  - this is up for negotiation but I expect the main floor and entry flooring to be replaced

# Extra Construction Items to Consider / bid

# Bifold door to deck
It's not clear if this is in the budget. It would be a very nice addition. Expected work:
* Remove current door/windows to ~120in wide opening
* build new header across opening
* replace and frame in new upper glass units
* install new bifold door
* Have upper glass film'd (to match current film on other upper windows)
