# East Beam Connection
This is the detail of the connection between the beam entering the house from the East and landing on the kitchen North wall:

Multiple options exist for opening the space between the ceiling beams currently supported by the wall displayed here. In either case the goal is to "extend" the current beam line another approx 4' to the next ceiling beam to the West. Since the beams are painted seams can be filled / sanded / painted and will largely disappear. The connection at the top of the post probably needs metal either way - that is excluded from drawings below.

## Option 1
Option 1 trims the current beam on top of the post and butts a new extension beam on top of the post. It's unclear if this work can be done without installing temporary supports to hold up current loads.

### Structural Construction Steps

* Demo subject area to enable new framing
* erect 2 temporary "jacks" to hold up N-S ceiling beams on both sides of the E-W span beam
* erect temporary "jack" to hold the E-W span-beam
* Slice E-W span beam vertically between notched-in top-plate and top of post & remove West portion
* Install jack stud to support West side of new extension beam
* Butt new extension beam against current span beam and secure in place
* Install metal strap across span-beam, post, extension-beam - possibly [APVST](https://www.strongtie.com/avantcollection_outdooraccents/apvst_strap/p/apvst)

## Option 3
Option 3 uses the excess current beam length to create a half-lap connection with a nex extension beam. This may simplify construction by leaving the current loads undisturbed at the expense of a mildly more complex joint.

### Structural Construction Steps

* Demo subject area to enable new framing
* Half-Lap cut E-W span-beam West of post support and remove West portion
* Install jack stud to support West side of new extension beam
* Half-lap cut new extension beam
* "tetris" in new extension beam and secure with countersunk structural screws
* Install metal strap across span-beam, post, extension-beam - possibly [APVST](https://www.strongtie.com/avantcollection_outdooraccents/apvst_strap/p/apvst)

# Pass Through
We want to increase the height of the pass through between the current kitchen and West dining room.
